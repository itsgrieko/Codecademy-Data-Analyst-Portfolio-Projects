# Codecademy-Data-Analyst-Portfolio-Projects

A place for me to showcase the portfolio projects done through the Codecademy Data Science course.

## Medical Insurance
The first Codecademy portfolio project. Ultimately it just came down to manipulating a large list of dictionaries, supplied through csv. Decided not to spend too much time on it since it's quite basic.
## Hurricanes
Mainly a python project about dictionary using information on hurricanes. Heavy use of for loops and if/else statements.
## Jeopardy
A project about data frame manipulation using Pandas, using a dataset from popular gameshow Jeopardy.
## Netflix and Stocks
A project primarily about plotting data using matplotlib's pyplot, with some minor dataframe manipulation with Pandas. Plots used included bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots and violin plots. Plot manipulation (titles, xticks, size, layout) is also included.
## Kiva Loans
A project around using Seaborn instead of pyplot to create visualizations. Used bar charts, box plots, and violin plots. Also modified graph styling including color palettes, graph sizes, and hue, to aid data visualization.
